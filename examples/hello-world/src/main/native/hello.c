 * Some trivial C code showing the native parts of the greetings.Hello

 * Uses only 'standard C' constructs, so lives in src/main/native.  A
 * more platform-specfic example might contain different C sources for
 * e.g. Linux and Windows, and even for 32 vs 64 bit builds.  In those
 * cases, place C sources in e.g. src/main/native/Linux/x86/code.c
